## Password Generator Application

## Description
This application provides two robust solutions for generating random and alternate passwords based on user-selected criteria. Developed to enhance security for employees with access to sensitive data, this tool dynamically updates HTML and CSS with JavaScript to offer a responsive, user-friendly interface. It supports a variety of criteria, including the inclusion of special characters, to ensure the generation of strong, secure passwords as well as an option to create a password using a memorable string, which i personally find much more usable.
- My motivation for creating this project was initially because I do not like the standard (USE STRONG PASSWORD) that was automatically generated by different operating systems. I created my own so i had more flexibility deciding the password generation and i added the alternate password generator purely for the use of a memorable string of characters with alternate forms for ease of use.
